# Kevin VanDonkelaar: The Super Developer

This is the third (and final) version of my personal website. I developed it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Previous versions can be found here:

v1.0: https://kevin-vandonkelaar-personal-website.github.io/kvdcre8r/

v2.0 https://the-super-devloper-v2.netlify.app/

## Create - Develop - Inspire

#### I have adopted these three simple concepts as my motto as I embark on my new career as a web developer. My goal with this website is to display each of these in a tangible way. 

#### First, I used the superhero theme to show some of my personality and display my creativity. Second, I researched techniques and added extra features above the requirements to display my growing ability as a web developer. And lastly, I shared some of my personal info to inspire others.

#### I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I did creating it. Thank you.
