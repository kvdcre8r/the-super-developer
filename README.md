# Kevin VanDonkelaar: The Super Developer

This website is hosted on Netlify [here](https://the-super-developer.netlify.app/).

This is the third (and final) version of my personal website. I developed it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Previous versions can be found here:
[v1.0](https://kevin-vandonkelaar-personal-website.github.io/kvdcre8r/)
[v2.0](https://the-super-devloper-v2.netlify.app/).

I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I did creating it. Thank you.
